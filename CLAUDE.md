# Finch — Development Notes

## Adding a new API key

When you add a new external API key to the project, you must update **three** places or it won't reach the E2B sandbox:

1. **`backend/core/config.py`** — add the field to `Settings` so it loads from `.env`
2. **`backend/.env`** — add the actual key value
3. **`backend/modules/tools/skills_registry.py` → `SKILL_ENV_KEYS`** — add the env var to the whitelist so `_build_sandbox_env()` forwards it to the sandbox

If you skip step 3, the key will be available on the backend server but **not** inside the E2B sandbox where skills and user code run.

Example entry in `SKILL_ENV_KEYS`:
```python
"MY_NEW_API_KEY": ("MY_SERVICE", "system"),
```

Use `"system"` for keys shared across all users (from `.env`). Use `"user"` for per-user keys stored in the DB.

## Where env values & secrets live (NOT committed)

All real values are in gitignored files / EAS — never hardcode them in tracked code.

**Mobile app production env (`EXPO_PUBLIC_*`):** source of truth for builds is **EAS env vars**, environment `production` (`cd frontend-mobile && eas env:list --environment production`). A local mirror lives in gitignored **`frontend-mobile/.env.production`**. `frontend-mobile/.env` holds the local-dev values (API URL = `localhost`).
- These must be set on EAS or the production build ships with an empty `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, and `createClient('')` throws at module load → **crash on launch** (this caused the v1.0(20) App Store rejection).
- Production backend: `https://finch-production-8434.up.railway.app` (Railway).

**App Store reviewer / E2E test account:** credentials are `E2E_EMAIL` / `E2E_PASSWORD` in gitignored **`frontend/.env.local`**, **`backend/.env`**, and **`frontend-mobile/.env`**. `tests/auth.setup.ts` (web + mobile) reads them from env and throws if unset — no hardcoded fallback. When filling `frontend-mobile/APP_STORE_REVIEW.md` for a submission, paste the values from there; don't commit them.

## Adding / turning on a skill

A skill is a folder `backend/skills/<name>/` with a `SKILL.md` (frontmatter: `name`, `description`, `metadata`). It's auto-discovered — no registration. It syncs to the sandbox by content hash (no backend restart needed).

How it surfaces to the agent:
- **Always:** its one-line `description` appears in the all-skills list (in the `execute_code`/`bash` tool description).
- **`auto_on: true`** in `metadata` → also always in the system prompt's `<available_skills>` block. Omit it → the skill is only active when the user selects it for the chat.
- The full `SKILL.md` is **never** inlined; the agent reads it on demand. So put real usage detail in `SKILL.md` and keep `description` tight.

So: to make a new skill always available, set `auto_on: true`.

## Keeping Web & Mobile in Sync

The project has two frontends that must stay in parity:
- **Web**: Next.js in `frontend/` (App Router + Tailwind)
- **Mobile**: Expo/React Native in `frontend-mobile/` (Expo Router + NativeWind)

### Convention
When adding or changing a feature in one frontend, check whether the other needs a matching update. Note it in the PR description. Features should exist in both unless there's a platform-specific reason not to.

### Shared API Layer
Both frontends call the same backend. The API function names in `lib/api.ts` should match across web and mobile. When adding a new API endpoint, add the client function to both.

## In-App Purchase (iOS Pro subscription)

The **Pro** plan is sold two ways, both writing the same `user_accounts.plan`
(`subscription_provider` records the owner: `stripe` | `apple`):
- **Web** → Stripe Checkout (`/credits/checkout` + `/credits/webhook`).
- **iOS** → Apple In-App Purchase via **RevenueCat** (App Store Guideline 3.1.1).
  Client: `frontend-mobile/lib/purchases.ts` + `PaywallModal.tsx`. Backend:
  `POST /credits/revenuecat-webhook` (auth via `REVENUECAT_WEBHOOK_AUTH`).

Dashboard/product setup (ASC subscription product, RevenueCat entitlement
`pro`, offering, webhook secret, EAS `EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_IOS_KEY`) is the
manual part — see **`docs/iap-setup.md`**. IAP no-ops gracefully when the key is
unset, so local/Expo-Go dev is unaffected.

## Chat Logs

Agent chat logs are saved locally at `backend/chat_logs/YYYYMMDD/<timestamp>_<chat_id>/master/`. Each chat directory contains:
- `messages.jsonl` — full message history (user, assistant, tool calls and results)
- `conversation.json` — conversation metadata
- `cache_diagnostics.jsonl` — prompt caching stats
- `code_executions/` — sandbox execution logs

Use these to debug agent behavior (e.g., which tools the model called, truncated outputs, etc.).
