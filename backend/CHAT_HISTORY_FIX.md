# Chat History Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **User Messages Not Being Saved in Streaming Flow**
- **Problem**: User messages were never stored in the database during the streaming flow
- **Fix**: Now save user message FIRST before starting the streaming process
- **Location**: `chat_service.py` line 233-242

### 2. **Message Tracking Bug in Agent**
- **Problem**: `get_new_messages()` was incorrectly excluding messages because the initial message count included the user message
- **Fix**: Properly track the initial message length to only return new assistant/tool messages after streaming
- **Location**: `chat_agent.py` lines 49-51

### 3. **Missing Resource Creation in Streaming Flow**
- **Problem**: Resources (tables/data) weren't being created for tool results in streaming mode
- **Fix**: Added tool call tracking during streaming and resource creation after stream completes
- **Features**:
  - Track tool call info in `_tool_calls_info` list during streaming
  - Create resources for successful tool calls
  - Link tool result messages to resources via `resource_id`
- **Location**: `chat_service.py` lines 258-312 and `chat_agent.py` lines 245-253

### 4. **Code Simplification - Removed Non-Streaming Flow**
- **Removed**: Non-streaming `send_message()` method and `/chat` endpoint
- **Kept**: Only streaming flow via `send_message_stream()` and `/chat/stream`
- **Rationale**: Simpler codebase, only one code path to maintain

## Message Flow (Streaming)

```
1. Save user message to DB (sequence N)
2. Build API messages from chat history
3. Stream LLM response
4. For each tool call:
   - Execute tool
   - Track tool call info (for resource creation)
   - Save to messages array
5. After streaming completes:
   - Create resources from tool results
   - Save all assistant + tool messages (sequence N+1, N+2, ...)
   - Link tool messages to resources
6. Chat history is now complete and consistent
```

## Key Features

- ✅ User messages always saved
- ✅ Tool calls tracked with full metadata
- ✅ Resources created and linked to messages
- ✅ Proper message sequencing
- ✅ Single code path (streaming only)
- ✅ Chat history maintains full context including tool calls
