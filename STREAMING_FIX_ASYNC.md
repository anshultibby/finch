# Critical Streaming Fix: Async Completion

## The Problem

Streaming was **severely delayed** - all chunks were buffered and sent at once after the LLM finished, instead of appearing word-by-word in real-time.

### Root Cause

We were using LiteLLM's **sync** `completion()` function with `stream=True` inside an **async generator**. This caused:

1. **Event loop blocking**: The sync iterator blocked Python's async event loop
2. **Uvicorn buffering**: Uvicorn couldn't send chunks incrementally because it was waiting for the blocking call
3. **All-at-once delivery**: All chunks accumulated and sent together after the entire stream completed

### The Fix

Changed from sync `completion()` to async `acompletion()`:

```python
# BEFORE (blocking async event loop)
from litellm import completion

stream_response = completion(
    model=self.model,
    messages=messages,
    api_key=Config.OPENAI_API_KEY,
    tools=ALL_TOOLS,
    stream=True
)

for chunk in stream_response:  # Blocking iteration!
    yield event

# AFTER (non-blocking)
from litellm import acompletion

stream_response = await acompletion(
    model=self.model,
    messages=messages,
    api_key=Config.OPENAI_API_KEY,
    tools=ALL_TOOLS,
    stream=True
)

async for chunk in stream_response:  # Non-blocking!
    yield event
```

## Files Changed

### `backend/modules/agent/chat_agent.py`
- Changed import: `from litellm import completion` â†’ `from litellm import acompletion`
- Updated all `completion()` calls to `await acompletion()`
- Changed `for chunk` to `async for chunk`
- Applied to both streaming and non-streaming methods

### `backend/routes/chat.py`
- Added `import asyncio`
- Added `await asyncio.sleep(0)` in generator (helps with event loop scheduling)

### `backend/main.py`
- Added uvicorn configuration for better streaming behavior

## Impact

**Before:**
- User sends message
- Backend processes (3-5 seconds)
- **All text appears at once** ðŸ˜ž

**After:**
- User sends message
- **Text appears immediately, word-by-word** âœ¨
- True streaming experience

## Technical Details

### Why This Matters

In async Python:
- **Sync iterators** block the event loop - nothing else can happen
- **Async iterators** yield control back to the event loop between iterations
- Uvicorn can only send data when it gets control of the event loop

When we used `for chunk in stream_response:` (sync), the entire loop had to complete before Uvicorn could send anything. With `async for chunk in stream_response:`, Uvicorn gets control after each chunk and can send it immediately.

### LiteLLM Functions

- `completion()` - Returns sync iterator (blocks event loop)
- `acompletion()` - Returns async iterator (non-blocking)

Both support:
- Streaming (`stream=True`)
- Non-streaming (default)
- Tool calling
- All the same parameters

## Testing

After restarting the backend, you should see:

### Backend Logs
```
ðŸ“¤ Streaming delta #1: 'Here'...
ðŸ“¤ Streaming delta #2: ' is'...
ðŸ“¤ Streaming delta #3: ' your'...
ðŸ“¤ Streaming delta #4: ' portfolio'...
```

### Frontend
- Text appears **immediately**
- Each word shows up as it's generated
- No more waiting for complete response

## Restart Required

**You must restart the backend** for these changes to take effect:

```bash
# Stop the backend (Ctrl+C)
./start-backend.sh
```

Then test by asking any question - you should see streaming immediately!

## Bonus Improvements

Also added debugging logs to track:
- Chunk counts
- Character counts
- Timing information

These can be removed later once streaming is confirmed working.
