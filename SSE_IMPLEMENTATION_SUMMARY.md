# SSE Implementation Summary

## What Was Done

We implemented a robust Server-Sent Events (SSE) pattern for real-time tool call updates in your Finch application. This ensures users see tool calls **as they are being made** (not after completion).

## Key Changes

### Backend Changes

1. **Created SSE Event Models** (`backend/models/sse.py`)
   - Type-safe Pydantic models for all SSE events
   - `ToolCallStartEvent` - Sent when tool starts
   - `ToolCallCompleteEvent` - Sent when tool finishes
   - `AssistantMessageEvent` - Final response
   - `DoneEvent` - Stream complete
   - `ErrorEvent` - Error handling

2. **Updated Agent** (`backend/agent.py`)
   - Added `process_message_stream()` method
   - Added `_handle_tool_calls_stream()` method
   - **Critical**: Events are yielded IMMEDIATELY when tool calls start
   - Supports recursive tool calls

3. **Updated Chat Service** (`backend/modules/chat_service.py`)
   - Added `send_message_stream()` method
   - Wraps agent streaming with database context

4. **Created SSE Endpoint** (`backend/routes/chat.py`)
   - New `/chat/stream` endpoint
   - Returns `StreamingResponse` with proper headers
   - Original `/chat` endpoint still works (backward compatible)

### Frontend Changes

1. **Updated API** (`frontend/lib/api.ts`)
   - Added TypeScript interfaces for SSE events
   - Added `sendMessageStream()` function
   - Uses fetch with ReadableStream (not EventSource)
   - Parses SSE format and calls appropriate handlers

2. **Updated ChatContainer** (`frontend/components/ChatContainer.tsx`)
   - Modified `handleSendMessage()` to use streaming
   - Shows ephemeral messages as tool calls start
   - Updates messages as tool calls complete
   - Cleans up after 5 seconds

## How It Works

### Before (Old Pattern)
```
User sends message
    â†“
Backend executes all tool calls
    â†“
Backend sends final response with tool_calls array
    â†“
Frontend shows ephemeral messages (all at once, after everything is done)
```

**Problem**: Users don't see any feedback until everything is complete

### After (New SSE Pattern)
```
User sends message
    â†“
Backend starts first tool call
    â†“ IMMEDIATELY
Frontend shows "ðŸ”§ get_portfolio - Calling function..."
    â†“
Backend executes tool (takes 2 seconds)
    â†“
Backend completes tool call
    â†“ IMMEDIATELY
Frontend updates "ðŸ”§ get_portfolio - âœ“ Completed"
    â†“
Backend sends final response
    â†“
Frontend shows assistant message
```

**Benefit**: Users see feedback in real-time as each tool starts and completes

## Example Events

1. **Tool Call Starts** (immediate):
   ```
   event: tool_call_start
   data: {"tool_call_id": "call_123", "tool_name": "get_portfolio", "arguments": {}}
   ```

2. **Tool Call Completes** (after execution):
   ```
   event: tool_call_complete
   data: {"tool_call_id": "call_123", "tool_name": "get_portfolio", "status": "completed"}
   ```

3. **Final Response**:
   ```
   event: assistant_message
   data: {"content": "Here are your holdings...", "needs_auth": false}
   ```

4. **Stream Done**:
   ```
   event: done
   data: {"message": "Stream complete"}
   ```

## Testing

To test the new streaming pattern:

1. Start the backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

2. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Send a message that triggers tool calls, such as:
   - "review my portfolio"
   - "what's trending on reddit?"
   - "get recent senate trades"

4. Observe:
   - Ephemeral messages appear IMMEDIATELY when tool calls start
   - Messages update when tool calls complete
   - Final response appears after all tools finish
   - Ephemeral messages fade after 5 seconds

## Backward Compatibility

âœ… The old `/chat` endpoint still works
âœ… No breaking changes to existing functionality
âœ… Can migrate gradually or keep both

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Users see immediate feedback
2. **Type Safety**: Pydantic + TypeScript prevent errors
3. **Scalable**: Easy to add new event types
4. **Robust**: Proper error handling with error events
5. **Real-Time**: Tool calls shown as they happen (not after)

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `backend/models/sse.py` (NEW)
- `backend/models/__init__.py`
- `backend/agent.py`
- `backend/modules/chat_service.py`
- `backend/routes/chat.py`

### Frontend
- `frontend/lib/api.ts`
- `frontend/components/ChatContainer.tsx`

### Documentation
- `SSE_STREAMING_PATTERN.md` (NEW - comprehensive guide)
- `SSE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` (NEW - this file)

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Add Progress Events**: For long-running tools, show progress updates
2. **Resource Streaming**: Stream resource IDs as they're created
3. **Cancellation**: Allow users to cancel in-progress operations
4. **Partial Results**: Stream partial results for large datasets

## The Pattern is Reusable

This pattern can be used for ANY async operation where you want real-time feedback:
- File uploads with progress
- Long-running computations
- Multi-step workflows
- Real-time notifications

Just follow the pattern in `SSE_STREAMING_PATTERN.md`!
