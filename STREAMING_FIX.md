# Streaming Fix Applied

## Problem
The frontend was **not handling streaming text deltas**, causing users to wait for the complete response before seeing any text. The backend was correctly emitting `assistant_message_delta` events, but the frontend had no handler for them.

## Solution
Added proper streaming support to the frontend AND backend:

### Changes Made

1. **Added `onAssistantMessageDelta` handler** - Accumulates streaming text as it arrives from the backend
2. **Display streaming message in real-time** - Shows the message being typed out as tokens arrive
3. **Clear streaming state properly** - Clears on new messages, errors, completion, and tool call starts
4. **Stream initial LLM call immediately** - No longer buffer, stream text as soon as it arrives (MAJOR IMPROVEMENT)

## How Streaming Works Now

### Flow:
1. User sends message
2. Backend calls LLM and **streams immediately** âœ… (NEW!)
3. If tool calls detected:
   - Initial text (if any) already streamed
   - Tool call indicators show immediately âœ…
   - Tools execute
   - "Thinking..." indicator shows âœ…
   - **Final response streams token-by-token** âœ…
4. If no tool calls:
   - **Response streams in real-time from the start** âœ… (NEW!)

### What You'll See:
- ðŸ’¬ **Text appears immediately, word-by-word** (NEW!)
- ðŸ”§ Tool names appear as they execute (if tools needed)
- ðŸ¤” "Analyzing results..." after tools complete
- ðŸ’¬ **More text streams as AI analyzes tool results**

## Technical Details

The backend emits SSE events in this order:

**Simple text response (no tools):**
```
assistant_message_delta (streaming) â†’ assistant_message â†’ done
```

**With tool calls:**
```
assistant_message_delta (initial) â†’ tool_call_start â†’ tool_call_complete â†’ thinking â†’ assistant_message_delta (streaming) â†’ assistant_message â†’ done
```

The frontend now properly handles **all** of these events, especially the `assistant_message_delta` events that make streaming visible from the very first token.

## Performance Impact
- **Text responses**: Stream immediately from first token (~10-50ms latency)
- **Tool-based responses**: Stream initial thinking (if any), show tools, stream final analysis
- **No more buffering** - users see responses as they're generated
